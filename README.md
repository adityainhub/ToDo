# To-Do List Application

This is a basic to-do list application built using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The application allows users handle adding, listing, and marking tasks as complete.


## Front-End (React)

The front-end of the application is developed using React. 

## Back-End (Node.js)

The back-end of the application is powered by Node.js, serving the React application and providing an API endpoint (/api/tasks) to handle tasks, including adding, listing, and marking tasks as complete.
